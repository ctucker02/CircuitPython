# CircuitPython
My CircuitPython assignments. These are the beggining stages of using CircuitPython. These beginner assignments to help me learn about CircuitPython.

## Hello CircuitPython
### Objective
My objective is to start learning a new coding language called CircuitPython. This assignment is the intro to the new language, the objective is to make an LED fade in and out.

### Lesson
I learned about how the PWM is the pulse width modulation (how long the pusle is up or down). I also learned that the duty cycle is how long the pusles stay up or down.

## CircuitPython Servo
### Objective
The objective of this assignment is to make a servo slowly sweep between 0 and 180 degrees. We also had to make the servo move simply by touching a wire (capacitive touch).

### Lesson
I learned that the PWM encodes information by modulating the width of a pulse. Those pulses (and the width and frequency of them) are what the servo interprets as a message. I also learned how to use capacitive touch.
